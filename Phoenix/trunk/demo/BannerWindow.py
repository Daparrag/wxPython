It has a 500 to 1,000 year life-cycle,near the end of which it builds itself a nest of myrrh twigs that then ignites; both nestand bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix or phoenixegg arises, reborn anew to live again. The new phoenix is destined to live as long as its oldself. In some stories, the new phoenix embalms the ashes of its old self in an egg made of myrrhand deposits it in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis (sun city in Greek). The bird was also said toregenerate when hurt or wounded by a foe, thus being immortal and invincible - it is also said thatit can heal a person with a tear from its eyes and make them temporarily immune to death.The Phoenix is a symbol of fire and divinity.
