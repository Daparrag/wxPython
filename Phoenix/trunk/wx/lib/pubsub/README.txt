PyPubSub provides a publish - subscribe API that facilitates the development of 
event-based (also known as message-based) applications. PyPubSub supports sending and 
receiving messages between objects of an application, as well as a variety of 
advanced features that facilitate debugging and maintaining topics and messages
in larger applications. 

See the PyPubSub website (http://pubsub.sourceforge.net/) for 
further details, and to download. 

In order for easy_install to find the correct download links, they are listed here:

* `Windows Installer  <http://downloads.sf.net/project/pubsub/pubsub/3.2.0/PyPubSub-3.2.0.win32.exe>`_
* `Egg for Python 2.7 <https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pubsub/pubsub/3.2.0/PyPubSub-3.2.0-py2.7.egg>`_
* `Egg for Python 2.6 <https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pubsub/pubsub/3.2.0/PyPubSub-3.2.0-py2.6.egg>`_
* `Egg for Python 2.5 <https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pubsub/pubsub/3.2.0/PyPubSub-3.2.0-py2.5.egg>`_
* `Egg for Python 2.4 <https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pubsub/pubsub/3.2.0/PyPubSub-3.2.0-py2.4.egg>`_
* `Zip (source) <http://downloads.sf.net/project/pubsub/pubsub/3.2.0/PyPubSub-3.2.0.zip>`_

Note: "easy_install pypubsub" will install the egg, which is a zip file, whereas 
"easy_install -Z pypubsub" will extract the egg contents to a folder; this option will 
make importing pubsub much faster.
