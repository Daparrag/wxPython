<h2>NavCanvas in Splitterwindow</h2>
<hr>

<p>In general, you can put fc.NavCanvas (or fc.FloatCanvas) into any kind of
other window, including dialogs etc.. This demo shows how to put the NavCanvas
into a wx.SplitterWindow as an example.</p>

<p>This is the same as the simple example in the Getting started part of the
tutorial. Except the NavCanvas is now put onto the right side of a
wx.SplitterWindow.</p>
