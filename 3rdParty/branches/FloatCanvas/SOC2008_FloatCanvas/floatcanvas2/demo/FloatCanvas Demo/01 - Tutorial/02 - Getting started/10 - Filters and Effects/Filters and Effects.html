<h2>Filter and Effects</h2>

re-render and re-evaluated. Once this is fixed, this example should run at
interactive speeds again.</b></blockquote>

<p>FloatCanvas provides filters which you can use to achieve special effects.</p>
<p>There are some builtin filters like a drop shadow, 3d look, glow and pixelize filter
but you are free (and encouraged) to write some of your own.</p>
<p>Filters simply take a rendered surface of the node, perform some transformation on
the pixel data and then can draw this pixel data in addition to the node.</p>

<p>Also checkout the pie-chart example, it makes use of filters to render
shadows for the text and button and a 3D effect to make the pie-chart look
more plastic</p>
