<h2>Groups</h2>
<hr>

<p>So far we have only created individual models. Now it's time to explore groups.
As we discussed earlier the canvas is just a tree of nodes. When we added
shapes to the canvas we added lots of children to the root node. So the root
node (the canvas) can be perceived as a group.</p>
<p>You can create now groups on your own by doing this: First you create the parent
node which is kind of like the "head" of the group. Then you create multiple
other nodes and add them as children of this parent/"head" node. Voila, your
group was created. Any node can serve as a group, so if you create a rectangle
you can add a circle as a child to that rectangle. There's also a special group
node without any shape where you can add children too.</p>
<p>Now, if you move the parent node the children will follow it! If you scale the
parent, the children will get bigger too. You can also create groups in groups.
A practical example: Say you want to display an image gallery. You could make a
group for every row and then put all rows into a gallery group. Finally you 
put all individual galleries into an "all galleries" group.</p>
<p>If you want to know how groups work in detail please read on. </p>

<blockquote>Warning: The next two paragraphs might be hard to understand if you never dealt
with similar things before. If it seems incomprehensible, just skip them and
take a look at the practical part of groups</blockquote>

<p>Now what's so special about groups and children and parents? I hope you still
remember what transforms are, we dealt with this topic earlier. Now a child
inherits the transform of its parent node. The transform of the child is now
relative to its parent node. In simple words, this means if you move the parent
node 5 units to the left, all its child nodes will move 5 units to left.</p>
<p>In detail: Say the parent is at position (5,0). Now the child transform has a
position of (0,5). This means the child appears at (5,5). Now if you move the
parent by 3 units on the y-axis, the parent position is (5,3). The local child
transform is still (0, 5) because you did not change this. But the child's
*world* transform is (5,8) now. The world transform defines where the object is
rendered later. The local transform of the object defines the offset relative to
the parent.</p>
<p>Important things to keep in mind: A node has a local and a world transform. The
world transform is just the local transforms of all its parents multiplied with
each other and then multiplied by the nodes own local transform.</p>
<p>The first part of the source shows how to use groups in a practical and
intuitive way without you having to think about all this transform mumbo-jumbo. 
The mechanics of the local and world transforms are investigated in the second part
of the source.</p>
