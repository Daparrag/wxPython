<h2>Welcome to the FloatCanvas Demo!</h2>
<hr>

<p>Welcome to the FloatCanvas demo! This demo features a tutorial part where you can
learn about all areas of FloatCanvas ranging from installation instructions to
creating simple drawings and using many of the advanced features. A lot of the
examples come with example code and you can view the code being executed live!</p>
<p>The tree on the left is used for navigation while this panel here and the
tabs right over it are used for navigation inside a specific example.</p>
<br>
<p>And now... <b>Enjoy! :-)</b></p>
