<title>Simple SVG importer</title>

<h2>Simple SVG importer</h2>
<hr>

<p>FloatCanvas has no built-in svg importer, because the parsing step is a
really complex task, especially if you start and add scripts, animations,
stylesheets, filters and the like.</p>

<p>This demo shows how an importer which can load very very simple svg files.
</p>

<p>If you want to make this better, you could combine it with this project:
<a>http://code.google.com/p/wxpsvg/</a> which already uses wx.GraphicsContext
internally.</p>
