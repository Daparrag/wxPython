<title>Migration from the old FloatCanvas package to FloatCanvas2</title>

<h2>Migration from the old FloatCanvas package to FloatCanvas2</h2>
<hr>

<p>If you are a user of the old FloatCanvas package and want to use FloatCanvas2,
you need to (partially) rewrite your application. This is because FloatCanvas2
differs from FloatCanvas in several ways and writing a compatability layer
seemed to be too much work for the marginal merits it gives.</p>

<p>So what do you need to pay attention to when writing for FloatCanvas2?</p>

<p>First of all you should really, really work through this tutorial from start
to end. It tells you almost everything you'll need.</p>
<p>Most of the functionality present in fc1 is also present in fc2. It might be
called differently, it might work differently, but fc2 allows you to do almost
everything that fc1 did plus a lot more.</p>
<p>Things which are missing are the unscaled primitives (constant screen size ones)
right now. They're possible to do, but they have just not been done. If you
really want them, you can always provide a patch of course :-)</p>
<p>A little dictionary to get you started on your migration from version 1 to
version 2. Also ask on the mailing list if there's something unclear!</p>
