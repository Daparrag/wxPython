<h2>Animation</h2>
<hr>

<p>Sometimes you have the need to move things on screen. This can happen in a
variety of ways. You can put objects on a path and change their position
accordingly or you can tell an object to rotate around itself. You could
also want to change its color over time.</p>
<p>There's no special code for this in floatcanvas since the way you are animating
the objects is highly dependent on your application.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the source code, you get an idea, how you can move a few
objects around based on a simple wx.CallLater. A timer doesn't stall the application
like a simple loop would do. Other approaches might use threads or a simple loop
with an occasional wx.Yield.</p>
<p>There's room for future improvements in FloatCanvas here. For example it could
support linear interpolators, spline interpolator etc. out of the box.</p>
