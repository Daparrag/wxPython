<h2>Cameras</h2>
<hr>
<p>A typical fc.SimpleCanvas (fc.NavCanvas is just a specialized form of 
fc.SimpleCanvas) holds a default camera which is accessible via the .camera
attribute of the canvas. A camera is very similar to a regular node, it has a
transform and can be moved around. The camera is the eye through which you see
the scene. So if you want to take a look at different parts, or see a bigger
area, you want to move the camera or set its zoom factor like camera.zoom = 3.
(for really interested people: the view transform is the inverse of the camera
transform, so zoom is the reciprocal of scale).</p>
<p>Instead of accessing the camera directly you can also use the canvas.zoom*
methods which were discussed in the "Default Shapes" section above.</p>
<p>You can also use multiple cameras with FloatCanvas so you can switch between
different views in the scene easily.</p>
<p>The source code for this demo is not really great, it shows a view of the things
you can do with the camera, but nothing really exciting.</p>
