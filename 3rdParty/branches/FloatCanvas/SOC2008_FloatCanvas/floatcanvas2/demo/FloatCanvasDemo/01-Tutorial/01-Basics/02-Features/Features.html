<h2>Features</h2>
<hr>

<p>A non-exhaustive list of features goes here:</p>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Your data can be anything
<li>You can create custom draw objects to visualize your data in the optimum way
<li>Many default objects: Rectangles, Circles, Ellipses, Lines, Bitmaps, Text, Splines, Arrows, Polygons, ...
<li>Anti-aliased drawing
<li>Drawing objects with transparency (alpha channel)
<li>Sophisticated looks which can give different appearances to the same object
<li>Layers
<li>Filters and Effects
<li>Navigation around the objects
<li>Cameras
<li>Saving and loading
<li>SVG export
<li>Exporting images in formats such as png, jpg, tif, gif, bmp, ...
<li>Can do render-to-surface which allows for massive speedups if you have lots of static objects
<li>Based on a model-view pattern. If your model changes the view updates automatically (if desired).
<li>Almost arbitrary transforms of the objects, for example you can use a mercator transform if you want to visualize map coordinates given in (latitude, longitude) format.
<li>Many things I forgot to put here
</ul>
