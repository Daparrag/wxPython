<title>Render-to-surface and layers</title>

<h2>Render-to-surface and layers</h2>
<hr>

<p>Now for a more advanced feature of FloatCanvas. Until now you created primitives
which were rendered right to the screen. Well, in reality they were first
rendered to an offscreen bitmap and then blitted at once to the screen. This
technique is known as double buffering and helps to prevent flicker.</p>
<p>The same mechanism can now be exploited to render a node (with all its children)
to an offscreen bitmap. Then you render this bitmap instead of the individual
nodes. We will call this render-to-surface - the surface being the bitmap.</p>
<p>Say you have 1000 small circle nodes. Rendering them is getting a bit slow. So
you render all of those circle nodes to a bitmap and render the single bitmap
instead. This saves you rendering 999 nodes! You need to regenerate the bitmap
whenever one of the circles moves though.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the groups feature we discussed earlier you can now create
multiple layers, each one a bitmap with nodes. This allows to create very
dense drawings which still run at high speeds.</p>
<p>To render a node to a surface you do it like this:</p>

<p>Render-to-surface has another very interesting application which we'll discuss
in the next part of this tutorial.</p>
