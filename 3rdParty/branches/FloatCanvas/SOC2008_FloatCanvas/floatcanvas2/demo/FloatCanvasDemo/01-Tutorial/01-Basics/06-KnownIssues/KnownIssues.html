<h2>Known issues</h2>
<hr>

<p>As everything, FloatCanvas isn't perfect. There are some missing features or
bugs.</p>
<p>Here's a list with some of them</p>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Unscaled (constant screen size) primitives do not work
<li>Hit-testing does not work exactly if the outline of an object is very wide or
    if a low alpha value makes the object almost invisble.
<li>Offset (alignment, "Position = 'cc'" in fc1) parameter not yet implemented
<li>The internal dirty marking seems to have some problems at times
</ul>

<p>There are probably many more problems which are not listed here. If you
encounter something odd, please talk to us. See the getting help/bug reporting
pages for details.</p>
