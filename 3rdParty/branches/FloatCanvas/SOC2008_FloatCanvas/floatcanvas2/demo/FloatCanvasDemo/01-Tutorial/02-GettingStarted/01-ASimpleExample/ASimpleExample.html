<h2>A simple example</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Let's get started for real now. The next few lines tell you how to get something on screen. You can find the accompanying source code in the
floatcanvas/docs/tutorial/src folder. You can also just run the FloatCanvas wxPython demo (see section 4) and select the Tutorial tab.
</p>

<p>
When you run the code, you should see a black circle on a purple rectangle which sits on one of its edges. How was it done?
</p>

<p>
First, the run_standalone function is called. This one creates the neccessary
wxPython application and a frame window where we are going to put our canvas in.
Then we actually create the canvas and its contents via the "start" function.
After it was created, the window is shown and the application is run. So
run_standlone just contains some boilerplate code. The real magic is happening
in the start function which we'll take a closer look at now.
</p>

<p>At the very top of "start" you can see we first create a canvas:</p>

<pre>canvas = fc.NavCanvas( frame, backgroundColor = 'white' )</pre>

<p>
In this case we use the "NavCanvas" provided by fc. It allows the user to
Navigate around the contents of the canvas later. E.g. it provides buttons to do
zooming and panning. We tell the canvas to use white as the background color.
The canvas is the most important part of floatcanvas. It's the thing where
everything is drawn on. So you will very likely always create one. </p><p>
Remember that the wxPython demo allows you to modify the code. So if you want to
play with the background color, change 'white' to 'blue' in the code, run the
modified version and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
The next step is creating a circle. This is done with the line
</p>

<pre>canvas.create( 'Circle', 75, name = 'my first circle', pos = (0, 0), look = ('white', 'black') )</pre>

<p>
75 is the radius, a name is given to it, the center of the circle is put at
(0,0) and it gets a simple "outline white, inner part black" look. </p><p>
This is the standard way to add an object to the canvas. You call canvas.create
followed with the kind of object you want to add. Here it's a 'Circle', more
objects like 'Rectangle' and 'Polygon' are shown in the next example.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you could have written
</p>

<pre>canvas.createCircle( 75, name = 'my first circle', pos = (0, 0), look = ('white', 'black') )</pre>

<p>
which does exactly the same thing.
</p>

<p>
What both of these calls really do is this:
The canvas is basically the root node of a tree. The calls above create a
DefaultRenderableNode and attach it as a child to the tree. You can verify this
by examining the return value of the create call ( node = canvas.create( ... )).
You'll learn more about how this all works in the next examples.
</p>

<p>
Ok, let's progress to the next line. It reads:
</p>

<pre>look =  fc.LinearGradientLook( 'purple', (0,0), 'white', (30, 0), 'pink' )</pre>

<p>
This one is a bit more interesting. Here we create a "look". A look basically
defines what a specific object will visually look like. A look can be applied
to multiple objects giving them the same appearance. </p><p>
In this case we create a "gradient" look where one color ('white') is blended to
another color ('pink'). The outline is 'purple'. </p><p>
This is the look we're going to apply on the background rectangle object next:
</p>

<pre>canvas.createRectangle( (300, 300), pos = (0, 0), rotation = 45, look = look )</pre>

<p>
You can see how we set the look of a rectangle of size (300, 300) to the look
we've just created. Additionally we rotated the rectangle by 45 degrees.
</p>

<p>
Now the canvas is setupped and ready to be rendered (which happens
automatically).
</p>

<p>
Tadaaa, this concludes the first example. Hope you continue!
