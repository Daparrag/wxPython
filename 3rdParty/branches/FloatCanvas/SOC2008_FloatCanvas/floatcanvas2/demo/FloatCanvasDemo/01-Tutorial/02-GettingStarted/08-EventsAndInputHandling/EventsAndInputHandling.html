<title>Making objects do: Events and input handling</title>

<h2>Making objects do: Events and input handling</h2>
<hr>

<p>FloatCanvas can do more than just draw objects. You can also interact with them.
For example you can be notified when a user presses the left mouse button on a
shape or moves the mouse over it. Keyboard events are also sent, so if the user
presses a key while you're over a shape with your mouse cursor, this shape will
receive a key down event which you can handle.</p>
<p>If you want to receive an event from a shape, you do it like this:</p>
<pre>
node = canvas.create( ... )
def event_handler(event):
    print '%s event on nodes %s at pos %s, wx_event: %s' % ( event.__class__.__name__, event.nodes, event.coords, event.wx_event )
node.subscribe( event_handler, 'left_down' )
</pre>
<p>Possible events are:</p>
<blockquote>
left_down, left_up, left_dlick,
middle_down, middle_up, middle_dlick,
right_down, right_up, right_dlick, 
move, wheel, key_down, key_up
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to get at the original wxPython event which contains data such as
the mouse position, you can access event.wx_event.</p>
<p>Event provides other properties like event.coords (world position where the
event occured) as well event.nodes (all nodes at events.coords).</p>

<p>By default input event handling works only on a NavCanvas. If you want to use
your own canvas with input event handling, you can do the same thing NavCanvas
does. It uses the floatcanvas.canvas.guiModes module to bind all wx events to
raise the events for the shapes. Using it is as simple as doing this:</p>
<pre>
mode = floatcanvas.canvas.guiMode.GUIModeMouse()
mode.Activate( canvas )
</pre>
<p>where canvas should be a subclass floatcanvas.canvas.floatCanvas.FloatCanvas of.
See the navCanvas module for inspiration how the different gui modes work. It's
not difficult.</p>

<h5>Hit-testing excourse:</h5>

<p>The underlying mechanism to do this consists of multiple parts. The integral
part at the bottom is called hit-testing. Maybe you have noticed that
SimpleCanvas has a method called hitTest. It looks like this:</p>
<pre>
def hitTest( screen_pnt, exact = True, order = True )
</pre>
<p>You give it a point in screen coordinates (like the position of the mouse
cursor). The function transforms this point into world coordinates (the
coordinate system you've put all your shapes in) and then determines which nodes
intersect with the world point and returns those.</p>
<p>Hit-testing is just one form of a spatial query. By default FloatCanvas supports
another kind of spatial query: the bounding box query. A bounding box query
allows you to get all the nodes within a specific box. This is useful if you
wanted to implement a sweep selection mechanism for example. FloatCanvas uses
the same mechanism internally to cull all nodes before rendering, so only the
ones which actually end up in the window later will be rendered.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Canvas.performSpatialQuery and SimpleCanvas.hitTest function
for usage.</p>
<p>With hit-testing we have the basic mechanics in place to determine the specific
objects where events should be sent to.</p>
