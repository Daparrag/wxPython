<title>SVG export</title>

<h2>SVG export</h2>
<hr>

<p>SVG export is not much different from native serialization which you got to
know in the last lesson. You use the same calls, just with a different
extension:</p>

<pre>canvas.serializeToFile( 'savedcanvas.svg' )</pre>

<p>or the no-file, data version:</p>

<pre>canvas.serialize( 'svg' )</pre>

<p>The current svg exporter tries to export svgs so they look the same as outputted
by the wx backend. Sometimes this does not work if you specify strings for
colours like 'green', because svg and wx associate different rgb values with
them. So if you want to look images exactly the same, try to use rgb(a) values.</p>

<blockquote>Note: svg export does not show render-to-surface nodes and filter as
on-screen at the moment.</blockquote>
