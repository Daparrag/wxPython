<h2>Default shapes</h2>
<hr>

<p>
As you have seen in the previous example you can create circle and rectangle
objects. But there are many more. Here's a list with all of the possible shapes
along with the parameters you need to pass to them:
</p>

<pre>
Circle                radius
Ellipse               (sizeX, sizeY)
RoundedRectangle      (sizeX, sizeY), cornerRadius
Text                  'string'
Line                  (startPointX, startPointY), (endPointX, endPointY)
LineLength            length
Lines                 [ (point1X,point1Y), (point2X, point2Y), (point3X, point3Y), ... ]
LinesList             [ line1 (for format see line above), line2, line3, ... ]
LineSegments          [ (startPoint1X,startPoint1Y), (endPoint1X, endPoint1Y), (startPoint2X,startPoint2Y), (endPoint2X, endPoint2Y), ... ]
LineSegmentsSeparate  [ (startPoint1X,startPoint1Y), (startPoint2X,startPoint2Y), ... ], [ (endPoint1X, endPoint1Y), (endPoint2X, endPoint2Y), ... ]
Bitmap                pixels (in width x height x 3 or in width x height x 4 form or wx.Bitmap), displayAsTrueSize
Arc                   radius, startAngleInRadians, endAngleInRadians, clockwise
CubicSpline           list of 2d-controlpoints
QuadraticSpline       list of 2d-controlpoints
Arrow                 startPoint, endPoint, headSize
AngleArrow            startPoint, length, angle, headSize
Polygon               list of 2d points
PolygonList           list of lists of 2d points</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>
Circle                125
Ellipse               (100, 150)
RoundedRectangle      (100, 100), 30
Text                  'wxPython'
Line                  (0,0), (100,0)
LineLength            100
Lines                 [ (0,0), (20, 30), (90, 70), (10, -20) ]
LinesList             [ [(146, 399), (163, 403), (170, 393), (169, 391)] ]
LineSegments          [ (0,0), (20, 90), (40, 30), (90,  35) ]
LineSegmentsSeparate  [ (0,0), (40, 30) ], [ (20, 90), (90,35) ]
Bitmap                toucanData
Bitmap                toucanBitmap
Bitmap                toucanData, False
Arc                   75, 4.5, 1.5, False
CubicSpline           [ (0,0), (90, 70), (90, 20), (0, 50) ]
QuadraticSpline       [ (0,0), (20, 50), (80, 0) ]
Arrow                 (0,0), (40, -20), (20, 10)
AngleArrow            (0,0), 50, 20, (30, 10)
Polygon               [ (0,0), (20, 30), (90, 70), (10, -20) ]
PolygonList           [ [ (0,5), (50, 50), (5,0) ], [ (0,-5), (50, -50), (5,0) ], [ (0,-5), (-50, -50), (-5,0) ], [ (0,5), (-50, 50), (-5,0) ] ]</pre>

<p>
The source code to this lesson "Default shapes" works just like the source code
of the previous lesson. There are just more shapes created.</p>
<p>These lines here</p>
<pre>
    toucanImg = wx.Image( 'toucan.png' )
    toucanData = fc.arrayFromImage( toucanImg )
    toucanBitmap = wx.BitmapFromImage( toucanImg.AdjustChannels( 0, 2, 0, 1 ) )</pre>
<p>
just load the image of a toucan (with alpha channel) and then create a numpy
array from it (2nd line) and a differently coloured bitmap (3rd line).</p>
<p>The final line is something which often comes in handy:</p>
<pre>
    canvas.zoomToExtents()</pre>

<p>This tellst he view to encompass all of the objects on it. You can also call it
with canvas.zoomToExtents( boundingBox ) to zoom into a specific area of the
canvas. </p>
<p>It's signature looks like</p>
<pre>
zoomToExtents(boundingBox = None, padding_percent = 0.05, maintain_aspect_ratio = True)</pre>
<p>
Then there's also the canvas.zoom function with a signature of
</p>
<pre>
zoom(factor, center = None, centerCoords = 'world')</pre>
<p>
which allow you to zoom/in out of the current view and center the view onto a
specific point.</p>
<p>For more information refer to the docstrings of the zoomToExtents/zoom methods.
Most functions in fc have docstrings which should be able to help you.</p>
