<h2>Performance problems, Optimizing</h2>
<hr>

<p>If your drawing is two slow it can have two reasons:</p>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>You're expect FloatCanvas to do the impossible - like processing lots of data
     or drawing numerous full-screen objects per frame. 
<li>FloatCanvas doesn't process your efficiently enough.
</ol>

<p>Which reason is actually responsible for your slowdown depends on your very
case.</p>

<p>Common pitfalls:</p>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Moving lots of objects per frame (maybe moving them indirectly by moving the
   parent node)
<li>Rendering speed is proportional to fillrate (the number of pixels which are
   drawn on screen). A huge circle consumes more fillrate than a small one.
   So if you draw lots of possibly overlapping huge objects, this demands a lot
   of fillrate.
<li>Alpha drawing might slow things down additionally
<li>Render-to-surface with huge surfaces might be slow, reduce their size to speed
   things up. Doing render-to-surface too frequently also causes slowdowns. If
   you're doing render-to-surface on a per-frame basis, consider to drop render-
   to-surface altogether as there are no benefits.
<li>Rendering bitmaps might be slow on some platforms
<li>Your hardware is too old and doesn't support wx.GraphicsContext efficiently
</ul>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Make use of the render-to-surface feature and organize your nodes in logically
   separated layers. Say you have 500 static nodes and 20 moving ones, then it
   makes sense to render the static ones into a layer with render-to-surface
   enabled. On subsequent draws, you'll render only 21 objects instead of the
   520 you had to render before. This often speeds things up.
<li>Avoid moving lots of objects repeadetly if possible. If you want to rotate a
   rectangle, instead of rotating the rectangle, consider rotating the camera
   instead.
<li>employ custom rendering and/or update policies
</ul>

<p>If your workload seems reasonable and FloatCanvas is still too slow, please send
us a sample reproducing your problem and we'll take a look at it. For details
how to send the sample, please take a look at the "Bugs/Feedback" section in
this document.</p>
