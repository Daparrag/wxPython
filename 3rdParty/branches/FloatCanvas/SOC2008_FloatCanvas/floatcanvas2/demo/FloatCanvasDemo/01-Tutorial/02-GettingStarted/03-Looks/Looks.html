<h2>Looks</h2>
<hr>
<p>This part tells you about "looks". As we've seen earlier a look defines the
visual appearance of a node. If you run this example, you can see a few
different looks applied on different primitives which you got to learn in the
previous section.</p>
<p>FloatCanvas provides these looks:</p>

<p><b>fc.OutlineLook</b></p>
<blockquote>
  Determines how the outline of the object is drawn. This includes line colour,
  line width, dashes, line capping and line join styles.
  The inner part of the object is not filled.
  If line_colour is None, no line is drawn. Since the object is not filled, it
  will effectively be invisible (don't use it for this purpose though, there are
  better methods to do this).
</blockquote>

<p><b>fc.SolidColourLook</b></p>
<blockquote>
  Determines how the outline is drawn (see fc.OutlineLook) and fills the inner
  part of the object with a single, solid colour. If line_colour is None, then
  no outline is drawn.
</blockquote>

<p><b>fc.LinearGradientLook</b></p>
<blockquote>
  Determines how the outline is drawn (see fc.OutlineLook). The inner part of
  the object will be filled with a linear gradient. This means  you specify a
  start colour at some point and an end colour at another point and the colours
  in-between will be interpolated (blended) between those two points.
  The gradient pattern will be repeated if neccessary to fill the entiry object.
</blockquote>
  
<p><b>fc.RadialGradientLook</b></p>
<blockquote>
  Determines how the outline is drawn (see fc.OutlineLook). The inner part of
  the object will be filled with a radial gradient. This means you specify a
  center of a circle and colour, plus the center of another circle with radius
  plus colour the colours on the object will be interpolated accordingly.
</blockquote>

<p><b>fc.TextLook</b></p>
<blockquote>
  This one is a bit special as it can only be applied to text nodes. It defines
  how text is rendered.
  Available settings include size, family, style, weight, underlining, faceName,
  colour and a background fill look of the font.
</blockquote>

<p>  
Except for TextLook all looks can be applied on all shapes. Colours can be
defined as strings (like 'red', 'green', ...) or tuples of 3 or 4 number in the
range of 0-255, e.g. (255,0,0,128) for a semi-transparent red. The 4-tuple form
is (R,G,B,A). Take a look at the __init__ methods of the looks above to see
all the parameters they can take.
