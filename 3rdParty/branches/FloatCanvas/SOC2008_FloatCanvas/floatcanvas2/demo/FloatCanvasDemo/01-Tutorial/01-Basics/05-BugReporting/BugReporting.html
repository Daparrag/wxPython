<h2>Bug reporting</h2>
<hr>

<p>I think I've found a bug and want to report it. What's the best way to do so?</p>

<p>Please contact us on the mailing list (see the about page for a link) so we
can take a look at the issue and verify it's a bug. In case it's a bug, we'll
tell you what to do. Usually this means either you or us file a bug report (or
even fix it).</p>
<p>Of course patches are always welcome!</p>
