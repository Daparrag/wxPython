<h2>About FloatCanvas</h2>
<hr>

<p>FloatCanvas is a python library that helps visualizing your data. It can draw
objects like rectangles and spheres (and more complex ones like text, arrows and splines)
onto your screen. These objects can be animated, moved around and rotated.
You can zoom around them or bind events to each object (e.g. if you click the sphere,
it makes the rectangle turn).</p>

<p>The usage possibilities are very wide, ranging from map drawing applications to visualising
flow graphs. You could also use FloatCanvas to make a small presentation creation program or
to draw pie charts, it's up to you!</p>
