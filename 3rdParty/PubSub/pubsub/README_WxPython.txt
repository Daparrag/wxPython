# this file gets copied to wx/lib/pubsub folder when release to wxPython

For wxPython users: 

The code in this wx/lib/pubsub folder is taken verbatim from the PyPubSub
project on SourceForge.net. Pubsub originated as a wxPython lib, but it is now 
a standalone project on SourceForge. It is included as part of your wxPython 
distribution for convenience to wxPython users.

The source distribution on SF.net tends to be updated more often. If you wish to 
install pubsub standalone, there are instructions on the Install page of 
http://pypubsub.sourceforge.net. 

The documentation for pubsub is at http://pypubsub.sourceforge.net, and some examples
are in wx/lib/pubsub/examples. The WxPython wiki also discusses usage of pubsub 
in wxPython.
